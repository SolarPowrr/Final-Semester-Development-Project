# Grub Gets Grubs in Gravity Town – Group Interactive Project

## Introduction 


- Our team for the Group Interactive Project was assigned to create a videogame with a unique controlling mechanic. While others were given prompts such as Virtual Reality or Augmented Reality, we decided to go with Gyroscopic controls. 

- For me, gyroscope has always brought a very child-like sense of wonder to videogames it’s implemented in. Games such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Splatoon, and Mario Party have, thanks to the gyro controls, always incredibly fun and interactive, with gyro allowing for a certain level of immersion over the game world that might be hard to replicate otherwise. As a long-time Nintendo fan and somebody whose earliest childhood gaming experiences were with the Nintendo Wii, an era where their creativity was at an all-time high, I felt excited to work on a project with this prompt.

- As a team, we set out to explore how gyroscopic input could enhance gameplay beyond novelty, aiming for meaningful use of the mechanic and immersion. From the beginning, we knew that the gyro mechanic needed to be essential to the gameplay, otherwise it might serve to drive players away. This goal guided our design choices; We were particularly interested in how physical movement could translate into this control scheme, creating a deeper connection between the player and the game world.

## 1. Time Planning

- Early in the project, our team established a rough timeline broken down into phases: concept development, prototyping, production, iteration, and final implementation. Each stage had specific goals and outputs, ensuring we kept the momentum going throughout. 

- Research
- Concept Sketches
- Production
- Finalising

- With experience on previous projects, I knew that I needed to take my time, and iterate on my art, as opposed to rushing straight to production and finalising too quickly. Especially with another artist on the team, this forced us to make sure our core idea was strong enough to support itself.  

- One big obstacle for me, as well as the rest of the team, was the Easter Break. It was definitely a concern, as being away from the team, as well as not having the regular schedule of classes, would make development rocky at best. It was a tough hurdle to overcome, as we found it harder and harder to schedule time for weekly check-ins with the rest of our team for a strong sense of teamwork. 

- In the research phase, me and my fellow artist researched genres, artstyles, and concept art that we felt would match the game's controls. We knew we wanted the game to have a loose-fitting feel to it, being cartoonish, dramatic, and overall care-free. Inspired by games such as Super Mario Bros Wonder, a game renowned for its cartoony art style yet careful attention to detail,  we began to craft ideas for worlds, characters, and assets.

- By week two/three, we had moved onto the first concepts for our character and game world. Drawing inspiration from popular bug-focused media, such as Bug Fables and Hollow Knight, we slowly began solidifying the direction that we wanted our game and assets to follow. Very early on, we settled on a character design and name: Grub. We quickly fell in love with the character, and from there, created the rest of our assets.

- The production phase followed, where the task load increased. I was making rough concept sketches, primitive first iterations for the player sheets, and creating some basic ideas for objects our character could interact with. We decided that a tileset for our overworld wasn’t on our priority list for the moment, as well as other non-playable characters such as bosses or allies, so we postponed the production of those for now.

- Finally, in the iteration and implementation stages, I returned to older assets with the goal of polishing and touching up animations and tilesets based on testing feedback.

## 2. Demonstration of Research

- After talking to my team, we decided to sit down and plan the game out on a whiteboard, as well as draw some concept art. After much deliberation, we finally decided on the core idea of our game: a 2D platformer with a rotating world. By using the controller’s gyro controls, the player can rotate the world around them, shifting the gravity and allowing players to reach new places, drop items, and navigate around in a full 360 degree of movement. The levels would take more of a puzzle-platformer approach, inspired by other games in the genre, like Portal and Fez.
- The game would feature a 2D pixel art style, using a more muted, oily colour palette for the backgrounds, and something more vibrant for players and items. Our visual inspiration came from other pixel art titles that emulate a similar look, such as Super Mario World and Terraria. We also drew from early animation styles, incorporating fluid, rubber-hose-inspired movements to give characters a bouncy, expressive quality. This animation style not only added charm but also emphasized motion and interaction, something we deemed important to draw attention to in a game where the world itself was constantly shifting.
- Our goal was to make sure that the visual identity of the game complemented the gameplay. Since the game revolved around rotating the world, we had to consider how the art would read from multiple orientations. Platforms, obstacles, and environmental elements were all designed with rotation in mind—clear silhouettes, consistent shading, and intuitive visual cues were a must, so that all objects and ground elements would be clearly readable from every angle.

## 3. Production of Assets

- Next was creating the assets. I made the player animations fairly quickly, just to get the idea working and implemented into the game as soon as possible. Although I wanted the character to be bouncy and nonsensical, these early versions lacked any kind of complexity.

- After attempting to add some squash, stretch, and follow-through, I quickly realised that I was in over my head. Having very minimal experience with animation and frustrating myself that I couldn’t make it look like I wanted, I decided to go back to the drawing board, and study the techniques of animation a little further.

- After spending some time with it, I soon realised that in order to create the animation, I’d have to squash and stretch Grub’s face, something I was hesitant to do as I believed it may hurt the readability and silhouette of the character. However, after looking at squash and stretch in 2D platformers such as Super Mario Bros Wonder, I quickly realised that the effect didn’t take away from the character’s instant readability, so I decided to revisit it and iterate with a fresh mindset, which got me to make this:

- After taking some time and comparing the two versions, I could finally tell that I was making steady improvement with my assets and was beginning to reach a place I was pretty happy with, although I knew I was far from done. I decided now to begin working on an overworld tileset. While originally we had planned for the overworld to deviate from the regular pixel at style and instead go for a 3D low-poly style, I quickly realised this was slightly out of my scope of capabilities for this project, so the idea had to unfortunately be shelved. Taking heavy inspiration from Deltarune and Super Mario Bros World, I began to work on an underground-themed tileset, including some swappable tiles that feature decorations, I landed on this design:

- I then began work on the item sheet as well. Taking basic inspiration from Spelunky, I added some base items such as boxes and vases. A suggestion for a collectible from our coders was a small, baby grub, which the player would have to collect to beat the stage. With all of this in mind, I created these objects:

## 4. Finalising / Iteration

- After completing the initial version of Grub’s jumping animation, I shared it with a few friends for feedback. One consistent rhetoric was that the antennae should bounce along with Grub’s movement. This was actually something I had planned to implement early on, but had forgotten to implement. Once it was pointed out, it immediately made me realise why it felt incomplete, so I went back into the animation and added motion to the antennae, giving them a subtle bounce and follow-through as Grub jumped and landed. This small addition made a huge difference in making the character feel more dynamic and alive.

![GrubFinalV1](images/GrubFinalV1.gif)

- With the main production phase largely finished, I shifted focus to refinement and iteration. I revisited all of Grub’s animations—jumping, walking, and idle—and examined the timing of each frame. While the animations were expressive, I noticed that leaving all frames at equal intervals resulted in some movements feeling unnatural and not having enough flow. I experimented with adjusting the timing on specific frames, such as lingering slightly longer on the anticipation or landing frames to better convey weight and impact. These subtle changes added smoothness and improved the overall flow of the animations.
- Throughout this phase, I also paid closer attention to feedback from my team and test players. Whether it was polishing sprite outlines, or ensuring animations flowed seamlessly during gameplay, I aimed to fine-tune every detail. This final stretch was less about big changes and more about subtle enhancements that elevated the overall quality and polish of the project.

## 5. Implementation

- Now that everything was finally produced, it was time to integrate it into the game. By this point, our coders had already added support for Unity to display sprite animations using placeholder art, so it was as simple as adding the images, assigning them correctly, and doing some final adjustments. One issue I ran into was frame aligning; Even though I had specific timings for my frames to display in Aseprite, Unity had no native way of doing this for me, so it took a little time to manually tinker with the way the player sprites were handled to get the timings to match up.

- Another small but important task was making sure the transitions between animations—like from idle to jump, or walk to fall—felt natural in gameplay. I fine-tuned these transitions, adjusting blend times and animation conditions so that Grub's movements flowed smoothly and didn’t feel jarring. Once everything was in and working properly, it was incredibly satisfying to see the character I had drawn and animated brought to life inside the game environment.

## 7. Conclusion

- In conclusion, Grub Gets Grubs in Gravity Town was one of the most creatively challenging yet rewarding projects I’ve worked on. Working with gyroscopic controls pushed us to think outside the box and create a gameplay experience where the mechanic wasn’t just a gimmick, but something that defined the identity of the game. I’m especially happy to create artwork that not only feels expressive, but other people also agree is enjoyable and easy to read.
- Part of our project was to present this game at an expedition, which went a lot better than I’d originally thought. Many people told us our concept for the game was incredibly fun, and this was a game they’d consider playing (even people who don’t typically play games!) which was hugely inspiring to me. This means that our concept both had legs to run on in terms of being advanced enough to create a game around, but felt accessible enough for anybody to approach, which is the way I intended the gimmick to be. 
- Most importantly, this project reminded me of the innovation that’s possible within game making. Sometimes, a lot of game ideas come from being “derivative”, whether that be for artstyle, genre, or gameplay mechanics. However, a large majority of our gameplay loop didn’t feel directly inspired by anything, and yet still reflected successful games within the puzzle genre, and lead to something that was truly unique, and a game that I would genuinely be interested in, which is a large goal for me when it comes to making games and assets.



# Shopkeeper Roguelike - Group Mobile Project

## Introduction 


- For this project, my team was tasked with a very open-ended goal; create a game designed for a mobile phone/touchscreen user interface. While this sounds like a simple task on paper, user interface is often the most neglected part of game design, and creating something for a mobile phone increases this challenge by a significant amount. There is also a careful consideration to be taken into account about hardware; While high-end and low-end computers are very clearly defined within the PC gaming world, mobile hardware is often far less important, and are not usually intended for any kind of graphical capability.
- With all of this in mind, we knew we needed to create a game that was a lot more methodical than graphical. Rather than delivering amazing scenes and impressively curated art for our game as the hook, we knew instead the concept had to be fun, so fun that you could take it out of your pocket and immediately want to start playing. It also needed to have replayability, and needed a certain ease of “pickup and play” factored into it. With all of this laid out in front of our group, we decided on making some kind of 2D roguelike with pixel graphics. Many of our group members were already very interested in the roguelike genre, and for this project, it seemed like a perfect avenue. 
- Roguelikes, with their inherent randomness in terms of items, rooms, enemies, challenges, and other elements, create a perfect game that has “quick runs” - something you can pick up, spend 10 minutes on, and can continue another time. We were heavily inspired by games like Peglin and Balatro, and opposed to other roguelikes like The Binding of Isaac or Enter the Gungeon. The former favoured a lot more strategic thinking, and presented very few “mechanical demands" - the challenge came more from knowing what to do, and not how to do it.
- With this project, I wanted it to be my first real dive into creating a roguelike with scalable elements. In theory, roguelikes should be quite easy to make, given that your stat/attribute system is robust enough to handle a large amount of basic items being stat increases or decreases.

## 1. Time Planning

- Because of how quickly our team banded together to spend a night fleshing out the concept of our idea, we were ambitious to start development quickly. We decided to divide the work flow between the four of us so that we had one artist, one gameplay coder, one stat coder, and one person to unify the two sides and incorporate them both, which was my job. On top of that, my team let me know that I was free to submit some art for the project, such as character design or assets, which helped give me more to do at the beginning of the project.

- From the outset, we mapped out the development timeline across a shared digital calendar, breaking the project into phases: concept planning, system prototyping, asset production, implementation, testing, and polish. These were ensured via frequent check-ins and milestones with a private Discord server, with channels to organise the different elements of our game in order to keep everything organised.

- Deadlines were crucial for momentum—because we had a lot of passion for the game near the very beginning, it was important for us not to rush lots of work out in the first few weeks, and then fall behind because we’d overworked ourselves. Reaching over a checkpoint is obviously good news, but keeping our objectives reasonable and not causing too much pressure on ourselves to push work as quickly as possible in the beginning would help us keep both pace and interest. Scheduling key features like stat-tracking systems or customer generation early in the process allowed the gameplay loop to solidify while still giving enough time to create a sense of polish. 

---

## 2. Demonstration of Research

- Before starting the asset production and coding phase, I took the time to study similar mobile roguelikes and management games to understand how they tackled both randomness and accessibility. Our biggest mechanical inspiration came from games like Peglin and Balatro, both of which rely heavily on turn-based decisions in environments that don’t require much reaction-based inputs. These games stand out by creating an engaging loop that doesn’t rely on traditional combat reflexes, but rather smart decision-making and experimentation.

- Visually, we opted for pixel art because of its clarity on small screens, minimal performance demands, and timeless appeal. From a UI perspective, I looked into mobile-friendly layouts from games like Miracle Merchant and Downwell—titles known for elegant simplicity. These influenced our decisions on where to place important information, stats, and interaction buttons in intuitive places that don’t clog the screen space.

![UI Concept Art](images/ShopkeeperKerkelConceptArt.png)

- We wanted to add microgames, inspired by titles like Mindwave and WarioWare. These microgames were designed to be a “second channel” of quick-paced yet short interactions that would have to be kept in balance with the customers. Our minigames became chances to boost stats that affect shopkeeping in the long-term (e.g., increasing customer patience or raising prices), rather than gaining money directly. This asymmetry in reward systems was a key idea I brought to the table, and players would by default need to keep both in balance, but could later specialise into primarily a single mode of playing, given they had the right items to allow them to.

- Early concepts for the minigames were first verbally talked with the team, inspired by short sections of other games we all personally liked. For example, an idea of an item-matching microgame came from the gameplay loop of Unpacking, and another microgame being the player having to quickly memorise information from a list, and recall a specific entry, from Papers Please. Most noticeably, these loops all come from games with a shorter runtime, and a gameplay loop that’s considerably shorter than most traditional games.

## 3. Production of Assets

- The customer characters were also a big part of giving the game personality. Originally, when drawing the UI of the game, I had made the customer a simple black cat, just so that I could quickly put the idea onto paper and show it off. However, we quickly fell in love with idea of more cartoony animals with anthropomorphic traits, so that their emotions could quickly and easily be shown off with simple expressions, similar to how characters in Animal Crossing would react in very readable ways.

- These characters were mocked up in pixel form and placed in early prototypes so we could test spacing and animation handling. Seeing them in context helped me gauge whether their designs worked on small screens and if they stood out against the backdrop of the shop, as well as if their emotions were easy to read. We quickly realised that, while the facial expressions were cute, the characters would be much easier to read if they gave some kind of visual effect along with their emotion, such as an exclamation mark for being angry, or a heart if they were happy.

## 4. Finalising / Iteration

- As our deadline approached, I focused primarily on iterating the minigames. I ran a small test session with a few other students who weren’t part of the team to see how clearly the games communicated their goals. This was crucial because many users were confused during early tests about how stat boosts affected the core shop gameplay.

- To solve this, I added small UI icons that would flash above the player’s counter during customer service if a stat was currently being affected by a buff from a minigame. For example, a lightning bolt icon would indicate faster serving speed. This simple tweak made the connection between the minigames and shop performance much more obvious, and it was a big quality-of-life improvement.

- One of the most satisfying parts of this phase was seeing all the different elements—stat tracking, minigames, customer sprites, and upgrades—working together in a unified loop. These tweaks weren’t flashy, but we knew it would take large amounts of user feedback and playtesting in order to make small adjustments to the numbers.

---

## 5. Implementation

- The minigames each existed in their own self-contained scenes, so implementing them was a matter of importing the sprites, assigning animations where needed, and making sure all clickable elements worked on touchscreen. Unity’s event system was sometimes a little clunky with tap-and-drag mechanics, so the hitboxes often had to be a little more generous, something we found out quickly was true with many of the elements when testing on a phone.

- For the customer characters, I used Unity’s Animator to set up simple idle and “interaction” states—just enough to give each animal some movement and presence. I also worked with our dialogue manager system to ensure their speech was readable and varied. Dialogue was randomized per customer, so no two visits felt the same, even if the requests were mechanically identical.

- Once everything was in place, it was deeply satisfying to play through a full loop: start the day, sell to customers, play a minigame, get buffs, repeat. Watching other testers intuitively engage with the system without needing much instruction told me we had struck the right balance between depth and simplicity.

---

## 6. Conclusion

- Working on the Shopkeeper Roguelike project taught me a lot about mobile design and gameplay pacing. By focusing on short bursts of interaction, we were able to make a game that was easy to pick up but rewarding over time. More than that, I got to explore how game mechanics and visuals support each other—the way a sarcastic dog customer adds as much personality as a stat screen, or how a short minigame can completely change how you approach a shop interaction.

- Most of all, this project showed me how cohesive a game can feel when everyone on a team is passionate about different parts of the process. Whether it was the stat systems, the UI layout, or the silly customer dialogue, every piece worked together because we took the time to communicate and share ideas openly. I’m walking away with more experience, more confidence in my design skills, and—most importantly—a burning desire to keep making weird little games with personality.
